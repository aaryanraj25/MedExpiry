##Medicine Clustering Model

#Overview
This Medicine Clustering Model uses machine learning techniques to categorize medicines into clusters based on their properties and uses. The model helps healthcare providers and researchers identify similar medicines quickly, facilitating better decision-making in treatment planning and pharmaceutical research.

#Features
Automated Clustering: Automatically groups medicines based on similarities in composition, usage, and other relevant factors.
Scalable: Designed to handle large datasets of medicine data efficiently.
Customizable Clusters: Allows users to define the number of clusters and clustering parameters.
